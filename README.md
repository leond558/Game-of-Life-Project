# Game-of-Life-Project
Efficient Java-based implementation of the Game of Life, using object-oriented programming and a variety of data structures.

This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the classic cellular automaton simulation, the Game of Life. Leveraging the power of object-oriented programming, this project offers an efficient and scalable solution for simulating the evolution of cells over time.

The implementation includes a variety of data structures and data types, allowing users to choose the most appropriate data structure for their specific use case. Additionally, the project is highly configurable, allowing users to adjust the simulation parameters to suit their needs.
